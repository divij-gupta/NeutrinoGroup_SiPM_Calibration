Brief overview of Divij's code for the summer 2023 research project with Elena:

The c++ file and text file convert the binary output from the digitizer to root files to analyse - best to do this on the computer in the lab itself

bern_sipm_script is the final version and clean version of the analysis script specifically for those root files - 2ms 128 long entries from the digitizer with trigger from the LED

final_data uses the script above for my final 5 sets of data that I took to characterise the gain and hopefully get a breakdown voltage

general_notes is a crude 'lab book' detailing the steps I took in my work real-time and my though process somewhat briefly

testing_error_calculation is something I used to check the robustness of different choices of estimating for the error in the gaussian fits
